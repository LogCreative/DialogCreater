## Compilation

The compilation should be performed carefully because the file is too old to open-and-compile correctly on modern operating systems.

### Windows Batch File (`.bat`)

To edit this file, you need to open `WindowsCreate.bat` file in notepad or in Visual Studio Code with the encoding of `GB 2312`. Using UTF-8 encoding will make the code unreadable and saving it will cause **invertible damage** towards the original encoding.

### Visual Basic .NET (`.sln`)

Visual Basic .NET solution file requires Visual Studio 2013+ to open, with .NET Framework 3.5 installed.

Before opening the solution file, please confirm your display font scaling is 100%. Otherwise, the project file will fail to display correctly and save such will casue **permenate damage** towards the original file. 

The bug of not correctly display `toolbar` in `VB.NET` has not been fixed since 2014 for Visual Studio.
